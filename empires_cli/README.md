# Empires CLI

<p align="center">

</p>

A CLI tool to interact with the Empire and Realms contracts.

This CLI tool is meant to be used on the starknet-devnet and was built to showcase the capabilities of the Empire contract. It could be extended to work on the testnet or mainnet.

## Install

```jsx
cd empires_cli/

// installs all necessary dependencies
npm install
```

## Quickstart

In order to facilitate the onboarding of anyone wanting to test the contracts, we have created a quickstart CLI which:

-   deploys and initalizes all the contracts necessary to play Realms
    -   NFT contract
    -   Lords ERC20
    -   Resources ERC1155
    -   Modules
-   deploys the Empire contract
-   Batch mints all resources for the Empire
-   Mints a Realms NFT for 3 users (id 1, 2, 3)
-   Have user 1 and 2 join the empire

Simply execute `node index.js quickstart`.

# Examples

The below are two examples which use the commands implemented by the CLI: the first example builds a fish trap, forwards the block time, harvests the $FISH and
displays the total resources (resources are at the number of 24, with the two last resources being the $WHEAT and the $FISH) of the Empire and the user.
The second example starts a vote change for an Empire with 3 Realms and performs a change of Emperor at the second "Yes" vote. Finally, the third example issues
a bounty on an enemy realm.

## Example 1: Harvest

```jsx
// build a fishing house on realm tokenid1
node index.js manage-empire -e create -c "[1,0,1,5]"
// advance time
node index.js advance-time -s 30000
// harvest
node index.js manage-empire -e harvest -c "[1,0,5]"
// get empire resources
node index.js resources -e
// get user resources
node index.js resources -u 1
```

## Example 2: Round table voting

```jsx
// add the third user to the empire (not done by quickstart deployment)
node index.js join-empire -u 3 -t 3
// user 1 proposes a new emperor
node index.js manage-empire -u 1 -e propose_emperor_change -c '["0x1de4ff17901f1f23acb13a89f916d8812e65be11fe70d6ae8b1f2ffb0e02fde", 1]'
// user 2 can vote for tokenid 1 proposal, with his tokenid 2 and yes
node index.js manage-empire -u 2 -e vote_emperor -c "[1, 2, 1]"
```

## Example 3: Bounty

```jsx
// mint tokens to put in the empires treasury
node index.js mint-lords 1000 -e
// issue bounty on realm token 4
node index.js manage-empire -e issue_bounty -c "[4, 10]"
// check the bounty in the storage
node index.js read-empire -e get_bounties -c "[4]"
```

# Commands

## Starknet-devnet

Show the users info. Starknet-devnet deploys 10 account contracts by default. The first one will be used as admin account, the 9 others are treated as other players.

**show-users**

```jsx
node index.js show-users
```

**show-admin**

```jsx
node index.js show-admin
```

**advance-time**

```jsx
node index.js advance-time -s <seconds>
//node index.js advance-time -s 604800 (1 week)
```

## Deploy contracts

**deploy-realms**

Deploys all the necessary contracts to play Realms

```jsx
// deploys all the necessary contracts to play realms
node index.js deploy-realms
```

**deploy-empire**

```jsx
// deploys the Empire contract with admin account as emperor
node index.js deploy-empire
```

## Mint resources

**mint-resources**

Batch Mint all ERC1155 resources and transfers them to the Empire contract, this will allow us to directly test the gaming mechanics.

```jsx
node index.js mint-resources <amount> -e
// example node index.js mint-resources 1000 -e
```

You can also Batch Mint all ERC1155 resources for a list of users:

```jsx
node index.js mint-resources <amount> -u <users...>
// example empires_cli mint-resources 1000 -u 1 2 3
```

## Mint realms NFTs

Mints a realm NFT with a defined tokenid for a defined user

**mint-realm**

```jsx
node index.js mint-realm -u <user> -t <tokenid>
//node index.js mint-realm -u 1 -t 1
```

## Join the Empire

Allows a user to join the empire with his realm

**join-empire**

```jsx
node index.js join-empire -u <user> -t <tokenid>
// example node index.js join-empire -u 1 -t 1
```

## Manage the Empire

Allows the emperor to call the Empires contract to manage the empire, for example, build a house on one of the Realms. If you donâ€™t define the emperor, it will default to user 0. You need to specify the name of the function and the calldata as a stringified list.

**manage-empire**

```jsx
node index.js manage-empire -u [calling_user] -e <entrypoint> -c <calldata>
// example empires_cli manage-empire -e build -c "[1,0,1,1]"
// this will construct one house on realm token id 1.
```

Here are a few examples of functions that can be called by the emperor in order to manage his empire:

### Manage the Empire examples:

A non exhaustive list of some of the entrypoints that can be called through the manage-empire command.

**start release period**

```jsx
node index.js manage-empire -u 1 -e start_release_period -c "[1]"
// user 1 activates the start of the release period so now the emperor
// cannot build on it
```

**leave empire**

```jsx
node index.js manage-empire -u 1 -e leave_empire -c "[1]"
// user 1 is leaving the empire his realm tokenid 1,
// the NFT is transferred back to the owner,
// release period needs to be finished
```

**issue_bounty**

```jsx
node index.js manage-empire -e issue_bounty -c "[2, 10]"
// issue 10 $LORDS bounty on realm tokenid 2
```

**propose_emperor_change**
