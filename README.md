Get ready to embark on a journey in the Realms Empires, the next step to strengthen your reaml.
Get the synergy from multiple Realms working together under the direction of an Empire, linking
together Producer Realms and Attacker Realms to create the perfect attack and defense. Enjoy a
higher resource APY if you are a producer type or plenty of stolen resources if you are an
attacker type.

Finally, have the power of an Empire protecting you, issuing bounties on the Empire's enemy and
forcing nearby Realms to submission.

# Empires

The Empire allows a player possessing a realm to join together with other players and place the
handling of their realm in the hands of an Emperor. The Emperor will have complete power over the
realms of the Empire, which allows him to optimize the resources and the human power of each realm
based on its characteristics.
